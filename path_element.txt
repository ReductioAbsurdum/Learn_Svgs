Path Element: Most important element in SVGs

d=""
  - attribute that defines the shape of a path


Commands:
(upper case means absolute coordinates, lower case are for relative coordinates)
absolute: from 0,0
relative: from the last point location

M : move to
  -move to location
L : Line to
  -draws line to location
H : Line to horizontally
  - only argument is x
V : Line to Vertically
  - only argument is y
Z : Close path
  - closes path from last ending point to beginning point


Curves:
Infinite number of Bezier curves, but only two available in paths:

Quadratic (Q) and Cubic (C)

C: takes three points (x1, y1) (x2, y2), (x3, y3)
  -first point is control point for start of curve
  -second is control point for end of curve
  -third is where you want your line to end
